# Contributing to LOTUSim

This document explains how to contribute to the LOTUSim project.

## Contribution Philosophy

LOTUSim aims to foster research, experimentation, and interoperability in the field of multi-agent simulation.

A LOTUSim Governance Committee, established within Naval Group, oversees the overall coherence of the project’s developments.
In the future, the committee may include external personas (key partners or major contributors).

The committee publishes a roadmap highlighting priority topics and features, based on:

- Internal needs within Naval Group,
- Partner priorities,
- And community-driven contributions.

This roadmap is updated every six months and available in the Project Roadmap section.

New ideas that enrich LOTUSim are always welcome, even if they are not listed on the roadmap.

- For roadmap-related questions, please contact the [Product Owner](mailto:estelle.chauveau@naval-group.com).

The LOTUSim Governance Committee ensures:

- Technical consistency of the project core,
- Validation of contributions,
- Release publication in alignment with the roadmap.

Before proposing a contribution, please first open an issue (see the Technical Specification section).

## Types of Contributions

You can contribute in several ways:

- New features – e.g. new algorithmic modules for platform guidance.
- New models – for platforms, sensors, or environments.
- Enhancements – improving existing functions or models.
- Data contributions – use cases, simulation scenarios, or datasets.
- Bug fixes – code corrections, refactoring, or readability/maintainability improvements.

Please follow this process to propose changes:

1. Create an Issue

    - If none exists, open an issue on GitHub.
    - Use one of the following labels: new_feature, new_model, enhancement, data, or bugfix.
    - Clearly describe your proposal, including objectives, use cases, scientific background, and references if relevant.

2. Announce Your Work

    - In the issue comments, indicate that you plan to work on it.
    - Briefly describe your proposed solution or approach.

3. Fork and Clone the Repository

    - Fork LOTUSim and clone it locally.
    - Implement your changes.

4. Test and Validate

    - Ensure your code passes all tests and complies with the pipeline requirements (coming soon).

5. Push to a Dedicated Branch

    - Push your changes to your fork.
    - Use a dedicated branch (e.g., feature/my-feature) to facilitate feedback and updates.

6. Submit a Pull Request

    - Open a pull request.
    - Clearly reference the related issue and describe the implemented changes.

## Review and Integration

All pull requests are reviewed by maintainers and, if relevant, by the LOTUSim Governance Committee.
Feedback may include requests for clarification, documentation, or code improvements.

Once approved, your contribution will be merged into the main branch and included in the next release according to the project roadmap.
